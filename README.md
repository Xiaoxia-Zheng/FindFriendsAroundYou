# FindFriendsAroundYou

## Walkthrough
This project involves building a social application that allow you to find friends around you in a 1 km radius. 

1. When the application starts it would register with a username and a password, and a person’s name. Every time 
the application restarts, the user has to authenticate with the server making sure that the username and password 
are correct. 

2. After authenticating, the application would open up a google map interface which shows the user’s present location 
and the location of other people who have registered with the service and are within one kilometer of the user. 
Clicking on the pushpin you should display the name of the person. This is how it works: When the application boots up, 
it queries a php script on the backend and finds the location of the people 
registered for the service within a radius.

* Before you run the application, you need a Google Maps API key.
